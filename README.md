# Python-Scripts
Python scripts that I have found helpful.

readOrbital.py is a script that I adapted from the readMagnetization.py script written by James Pegg. The readOrbital.py script extracts the orbital magnetic moments from the OUTCAR file. VASP only writes the orbital magnetic moments if LSORBIT = .TRUE. is present in the INCAR file. Please refer to the VASP manual for more information.

Will update the descriptions for the noncollinear python scripts within the week.
