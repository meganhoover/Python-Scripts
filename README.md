readOrbital.py extracts the orbital magnetic moments from the OUTCAR file. LORBMOM = .TRUE. must be in the INCAR file. This flag tells VASP to write the orbital moments to the OUTCAR file. VASP only writes the orbital moments if LSORBIT = .TRUE. is present in the INCAR file. Please refer to the VASP manual for more information.
